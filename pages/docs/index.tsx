          First of all, you need to select what kind of contract you prefer. We
          have these options:
        </Typography>
        <Box sx={{ marginLeft: '3rem' }}>
          <ul>
            <li>
              TOKEN | PSP22: standard smart contract for a fungible token.
            </li>
            <li>
              NFT | PSP34: standard smart contract for a non-fungible token.
            </li>
            <li>MULTITOKEN | PSP37: standar contract for a multi token.</li>

          Once you select one of the options (Token, NFT or Multi Token), you
          will be able to choose one or more Extensions: Functionalities and
          Security.

        <Typography variant="h4">2. Compile your contract ‚öôÔ∏è</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Now you have your contract ready to be compiled. If you prefer you can
          copy/download the contract code and use it separately. For the compile
          step, you need to connect your wallet.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4">3. Deploy your contract üöÄ</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          After the smart contract has been compiled, you can deploy your
          contract directly on any parachain that supports the Contracts Pallet.
