          The Polkadot Contract Wizard is a non-code tool to generate, compile
          and deploy smart contracts on Polkadot. It provides{' '}

        <Typography variant="body1">
          First of all, you need to select what kind of contract you prefer. We
          have these options:
          <ul>
            <li>PSP22</li>
            <li>PSP34</li>
            <li>PSP37</li>

        <Typography variant="h4">1. Extensions choices</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Once you select one of the options (Token, NFT or Multi Token), you
          will be able to choose one or more Extensions: Functionalities and
          Security. All the Extensions are explained in the wizard but if you
          want to learn more, you can check our Extension section [link to
          Learn/#extensions].
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4">2. Compile your contract</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Now you have your contract ready to be compiled. If you prefer you can
          copy/download the contract code and use it separately. For the compile
          step, you need to connect your wallet.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4">3. Deploy your contract</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          After the smart contract compilation, you can deploy your contract
          directly on Polkadot or other parachains and testnets.
